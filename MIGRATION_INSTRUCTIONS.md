# User Isolation Database Migration

## ðŸ“‹ Instructions to Enable Individual User Workspaces

Since we don't have direct psql access, please follow these steps to run the migration manually:

### Step 1: Open Supabase Dashboard

1. Go to your Supabase project dashboard
2. Navigate to **SQL Editor** in the sidebar

### Step 2: Run the Migration

1. Copy the contents of `scripts/005_user_isolation_safe.sql`
2. Paste it into the SQL Editor
3. Click **Run** to execute the migration

### Step 3: Verify Migration

After running the migration, you can verify it worked by running this query:

```sql
-- Check if user_id columns were added
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name IN ('items', 'sizes', 'stock_transactions')
AND column_name = 'user_id';

-- Check if policies are active
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual
FROM pg_policies
WHERE tablename IN ('items', 'sizes', 'stock_transactions');
```

### Step 4: Test User Isolation

1. Create a test user account
2. Sign in and add some items/sizes
3. Sign out and sign in with a different account
4. Verify that each user only sees their own data

## ðŸŽ‰ What This Accomplishes

âœ… **Individual Workspaces**: Each user gets their own isolated inventory
âœ… **Automatic User ID**: New records automatically get the correct user_id
âœ… **Row Level Security**: Database enforces data isolation
âœ… **Auto-Seeding**: New users get starter items and sizes
âœ… **Clean Separation**: No shared data between users

## ðŸ”§ Technical Details

- **user_id columns** added to items, sizes, and stock_transactions
- **RLS policies** ensure users only see their own data
- **Triggers** automatically set user_id on insert
- **Indexes** added for performance
- **Auto-seeding** gives new users default items/sizes

Each user now has their own complete inventory management system!
